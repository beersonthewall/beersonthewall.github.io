    Reading Documentation
  </h1>

  <p class="blog-content">
    <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how to read documentation. Documentation is a hot topic among programmers, and for good reason. However, most of the discussion I&rsquo;ve seen is about <em>writing</em> documentation not reading.</p>
<p>How do you read documentation? If you&rsquo;re like most programmers I&rsquo;ve seen in my career you use documentation as a quick reference point. Some task for a particular piece of software (programming language, database, etc.) has you stuck. Severity of the &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; ranges from unknown syntax to &ldquo;How do I recover my corrupted database?&quot;. In a (possibly mild) state of panic you pull up the documentation, which contains a solution and you go on your happy way.</p>
<p>Another common way programmers interact with documentation is via the &ldquo;Tutorial&rdquo;. Learning a new framework can be tough, so most documentation contains a beginner tutorial that steps from installation all the way through a basic (but not necessarily trivial) example. After working through this example most programmers will start experimenting and get in a loop with the first pattern: don&rsquo;t know how to do basic task -&gt; lookup task in docs -&gt; solve problem -&gt; repeat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to propose that this is a broken way of interacting with documentation. Now to start I don&rsquo;t think the loop as described earlier is bad or wrong, since the whole point of documentation is to describe how to use software. Rather, I believe there&rsquo;s a missing step in the cycle. At some point shortly after reading the tutorial and experimenting a bit you need to read the documentation like a book, cover to cover. That&rsquo;s the missing step.</p>
<p>Now why would anyone invest the inordinate amount of time required to read documentation this way? For me the answer is context. Falling into a loop of stuck -&gt; lookup solution -&gt; rise and repeat often covers up fundamental misunderstanding of how the software being used actually works. Documentation quite frequently contains <a href="https://sqlite.org/arch.html">high level architecture descriptions</a> which details design tradeoffs and even <a href="https://sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html#sect_9_0">failure modes</a>. Taking the time to build your context gives you a high level overview and can help you avoid common pitfalls. A good analogy for never reading documentation cover to cover would be a greedy algorithm getting stuck in a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HpU8AbI.gifv">local maximum</a> never realizing that a better solution was nearby.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my personal experience both before and after using this approach, I feel like I&rsquo;ve gained a super power. I highly suggest trying it out and reading the documentation for you favorite tool cover to cover and see the results for yourself.</p>
